In the middle of the forest, there was a small cabin. 
The cabin had been there for decades, standing firm against the winds and storms. 
Many travelers had taken shelter in the cabin over the years. The old cabin had a fireplace that provided warmth during the cold nights. 
Every visitor who came to the cabin felt a strange sense of peace and comfort. 
They would sit by the fireplace and tell stories about their adventures before continuing their journey beyond the cabin.
