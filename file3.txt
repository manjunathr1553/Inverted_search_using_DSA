The sun was shining brightly in the sky.
The sun had been shining since the early morning, bringing warmth to the valley. 
The people in the valley enjoyed the sun as they worked in their fields. 
They knew that the sun was essential for their crops to grow. Without the sun, their crops would wither, and their harvest would be poor. 
The farmers always looked forward to sunny days because the sun meant prosperity and growth.
