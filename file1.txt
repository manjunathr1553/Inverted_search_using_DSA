The little cat loved to play with its ball of yarn. 
Every morning, the cat would chase the yarn around the living room. 
The owner of the cat would laugh, watching the tiny paws trying to catch the moving ball. 
The cat never got tired of playing, and every evening, the cat would curl up on the sofa, purring softly. 
No matter how many toys it had, the cat always preferred its old, worn-out ball of yarn.
